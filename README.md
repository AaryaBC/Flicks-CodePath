# Project 1 - Flicks

Flicks is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [x] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [x] Customize the UI. Changed the separator between two cells for a better look to the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Added a cancel button to the search menu and it loads the default results once the user hits cancel
- [x] Added a ratings view where the user can see the ratings of the movie in starts format.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Using different views and switching over views from different controllers
2. Using an embedded browser to play videos or songs for trailer
